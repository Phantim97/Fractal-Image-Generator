# Fractal-Image-Generator
Uses the Mandelbrot Set Algorithm to generate a fractal image. Coordinates are obtained via GIMP and copying desired coordinates.

Features are limited in current state, planning to add:
[X] Preset Menu 
[ ] Multiple zoom/ color presets
[ ] Manual input of rgb values and zoom features
[ ] Manual adjustment of fractal image in runtime
[ ] SSE Optimization
[ ] CUDA Optimization
